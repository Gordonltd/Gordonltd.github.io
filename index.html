                                    I am always up to a challenge whether it taking to the skies to get more flying hours under my belt (in the hopes of obtaining my Private Pilots License), living halfway across the world in China studying, or even just undertaking projects here in the UK. I really do not like to miss an opportunity to learn something or explore somewhere new. 
                                    
                                    <br><br>

                                    Project work is one of my strongest skills, with both my Extended Project Qualification (A-Level) and my Final Year Project for my degree. Winning recognition and awards for originality and novelty in both of these projects mentioned above.

                                    Problem-solving is a particular skill I have learnt to develop, whether it be by myself, in a team or even leading a team, exploring possible solutions to complex problems, although challenging can be fun especially when pursuing the most efficient or cost-effective method to achieve the desired result.
                                    
                                    <br><br>

                                    I have developed a lot more skills through my time in education and graduating from Liverpool University with a 2:1 in Avionics Systems and Pilot Studies with a year in China.
